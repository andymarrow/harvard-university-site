        "When Kazembe Abif was approaching his senior year of high school in Newark, New Jersey, he faced a dilemma. Abif, who is 6 feet, 7 inches tall, muscular, and broad-shouldered, had enjoyed and long excelled in team sports. Now college recruiters were calling and offering him Division I offers to play two different sports that he loved — football and basketball.",
        "Abif remembers what influenced his decision. 'I thought just for longevity for my body, the physical punishment that your body goes through for football, that basketball would be better,' he says.",
        "The student-athlete, who had worked hard to help his high school basketball team win two state championships, happily accepted a scholarship from Drexel University in Pennsylvania where he would be close enough to home for his family to be able to come and see him play. After receiving a bachelor’s degree in sports management and a master’s degree in hospitality management, Abif signed a contract to play for a team a little further afield, in a top-tier professional league in Germany.",
        "When the time came to pivot away from professional basketball, Abif decided to turn to something else that he was passionate about — working with youth. 'I always felt it was important to give back,' he says. 'We have to lift as we climb.'",
        "Abif was ready to start developing a different set of skills. He moved to Massachusetts and accepted a job with the YMCA of Greater Boston. The organization partners with Boston Public Schools on a program that uses a community school model."

        "At Harvard Law School, David focused his clinical hours on the Veterans Law and Disability Benefits Clinic. He didn't just study cases; he met with clients who had been denied benefits for decades.",
        "His approach is unique. He combines the discipline of his military background with a profound empathy for those on the margins. 'I’m going to be able to use the vehicle of the law to help people,' he says, reflecting on his upcoming graduation.",
        "Now, as he prepares to join a major public defender's office, David carries the stories of those he has helped. His journey is a testament to the idea that public service is not just a career, but a lifelong commitment."
